#' Food for thought on first day we looked at this data:

#' How many variables are there?
#' Can you clump them into groups for similar exploration and cleaning?

#' Do you like the variable names? No? What are you going to do about it? Will
#' each candy even remain as a variable or will it becomes ... IDK maybe a
#' factor level in a reshaped data frame? How will you track the relationship
#' between original variable names and the eventual variable names or factor
#' levels?

#' Timestamp ... can you make this a proper POSIXct variable?
#' How old are you? ... why is this character instead of integer?

#' How hair-raising are the free text fields, such as "Please leave any remarks
#' or comments regarding your choices."?

#' What do you think the clean, ready-to-analyze dataset(s) should look like?

#' Should we build some sort of ID for each respondent? What should that look
#' like?

#' What are some intermediate datasets you could form? Maybe you don't need
#' *all* the candies, maybe you can ignore certain types of questions at first,
#' etc. Give yourself some achievable goals!
