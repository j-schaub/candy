# Getting you started with the candy data
Jenny Bryan  
`r format(Sys.Date())`  
I'm putting the cleaning done during class plus a bit more here, in case it's
helpful to you re: homework 7.


```r
library(readr)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

raw <- read_csv("CANDY-HIERARCHY-2015 SURVEY-Responses.csv",
                col_types = cols(
                  Timestamp = col_datetime("%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S")
                ))
raw
```

Create an ID variable for each survey respondent. Bring that variable to the
front. Rename "How old are you?" to `age` and make it the second variable.


```r
raw_with_id <- raw %>%
  mutate(id = sprintf("ID%04d", row_number())) %>%
  select(id,
         age = starts_with("How"),
         everything())
```

Clean `age`. I only expect two characters and they should coerce nicely to
integer. Drop rows with `NA` for `age`.


```r
tmp <- raw_with_id %>%
  mutate(age_nchar = str_length(age))

ggplot(tmp %>% filter(age_nchar < 8), aes(age_nchar)) + geom_bar()
```

![](00_explore-raw_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png) 

```r
raw_with_id <- raw_with_id %>%
  mutate(age_nchar = str_length(age)) %>%
  filter(age_nchar <= 2) %>%
  select(-age_nchar) %>%
  mutate(age = as.integer(age)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(age))
```

```
## Warning in eval(substitute(expr), envir, enclos): NAs introduced by
## coercion
```

```r
nrow(raw_with_id)
```

```

```

First cleaning pass on the candy variable names. In tidy formats, these are
also destined to be factor levels.


```r
tmp_names <-
  data_frame(orig_name = names(raw_with_id)) %>%
  mutate(is_candy = str_detect(orig_name,"^\\["),
         new_name = str_replace_all(orig_name, "(^\\[)(.*)(\\]$)", "\\2"),
         new_name = str_replace_all(new_name, '["’]', "'"),
         is_changed = orig_name != new_name)
sum(tmp_names$is_candy)
```

```
## [1] 95
```

```r
table(tmp_names$is_candy, tmp_names$is_changed)
```

```
##        
##         FALSE TRUE
##   FALSE    25    5
##   TRUE      0   95
```

```r
names(raw_with_id) <- tmp_names$new_name
```

Write `id` and the candy variables out to file.


```r
candy_names <- tmp_names %>%
  filter(is_candy) %>%
  .$new_name
length(candy_names)
```

```
## [1] 95
```

```r
candy_dat_untidy <- raw_with_id %>%
  select(one_of(c("id", candy_names)))

write_csv(candy_dat_untidy, "candy-joy-untidy.csv")
```

Write a selective table to file in which there are no candy variables and
each row is a respondent. Dropping variables that I can't imagine using any
time soon.


```r
id_dat <- raw_with_id %>%
  select(-one_of(candy_names))
id_dat
```

```

```r
write_csv(id_dat, "candy-id.csv")
```

Tidy the candy data. This makes a rather large file and I won't be committing
and pushing it.


```r
candy_dat <- candy_dat_untidy %>%
  gather(candy, joy, -id) %>%
  mutate(joy = joy == "JOY")
write_csv(candy_dat, "candy-joy.csv")
```

Create some small datasets, suitable for practicing joins.


```r
candy_keep <- c("Snickers", "Hugs (actual physical hugs)", "Twix", "Vicodin")
id_keep <- c(178, 2254, 4817, 5522) %>%
  sprintf("ID%04d", .)

candy_mini <- candy_dat %>%
  filter(candy %in% candy_keep, id %in% id_keep)

write_csv(candy_mini, "candy-joy-mini.csv")

id_mini <- id_dat %>%
  filter(id %in% id_keep)

write_csv(id_mini, "candy-id-mini.csv")
```

Food for thought on first day we looked at this data:
How many variables are there?
Can you clump them into groups for similar exploration and cleaning?
Do you like the variable names? No? What are you going to do about it? Will
each candy even remain as a variable or will it becomes ... IDK maybe a
factor level in a reshaped data frame? How will you track the relationship
between original variable names and the eventual variable names or factor
levels?
Timestamp ... can you make this a proper POSIXct variable?
How old are you? ... why is this character instead of integer?
How hair-raising are the free text fields, such as "Please leave any remarks
or comments regarding your choices."?
What do you think the clean, ready-to-analyze dataset(s) should look like?
Should we build some sort of ID for each respondent? What should that look
like?
What are some intermediate datasets you could form? Maybe you don't need
*all* the candies, maybe you can ignore certain types of questions at first,
etc. Give yourself some achievable goals!
