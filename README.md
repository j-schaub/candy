## 2015 Candy Hierarchy

Benjamin Cohen and David Ng have been conducting a Halloween candy survey for a 
couple of years and writing it up:

This year in [STAT545](http://stat545-ubc.github.io) were going to use this as 
our final challenge in data cleaning, wrangling, and exploration. As we make 
progress ... who knows? Maybe this will become a proper data package? Maybe 
we'll make a gallery of visualizations? I have no idea where this is going. For 
now, I'm just parking the raw data in [data-raw](data-raw) for the students to 
work on in class and for homework.

Here's a visualization from Cohen and Ng ... wonder what we will come up with?
